Postmortem Report: Outage of E-Commerce Website Checkout Service
Issue Summary
Duration: June 3, 2024, 08:30 AM - 10:15 AM (UTC)
Impact: The checkout service of our e-commerce website was down, preventing users from completing their purchases. Approximately 60% of users experienced issues with processing payments, leading to a significant drop in completed transactions and potential revenue loss.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the payment gateway API credentials following a routine update.
Timeline
08:30 AM: Issue detected by a monitoring alert indicating a sudden drop in successful transactions.
08:35 AM: On-call engineer begins investigation by checking server health and logs.
08:45 AM: Customer complaints start coming in via support channels, confirming checkout issues.
09:00 AM: Initial assumption: potential server overload or database issues due to high traffic.
09:15 AM: Misleading path: Restarted the database server and web servers without any improvement.
09:30 AM: Escalation to the DevOps team to inspect load balancers and network configurations.
09:45 AM: Realization that recent update could have affected external integrations; focus shifts to payment gateway.
10:00 AM: Confirmed that payment gateway API credentials were incorrectly configured during the update.
10:05 AM: Correct credentials restored.
10:15 AM: Checkout service fully operational and monitoring confirms normal transaction levels.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: During a scheduled update, the payment gateway API credentials were mistakenly altered. This misconfiguration led to authentication failures when the checkout service attempted to process payments, resulting in transaction failures for a majority of users.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by reverting to the correct API credentials for the payment gateway. Once the credentials were updated, the checkout service resumed normal operation, and transaction processing rates returned to expected levels.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Credential Management: Implement a more robust credential management system to prevent unauthorized changes and ensure accuracy during updates.
Automated Testing: Enhance pre-deployment testing procedures to include validation of external API integrations.
Monitoring Enhancements: Improve monitoring to include specific checks for external service integrations to detect similar issues more quickly.
Task List:

Patch Nginx Server: Update Nginx configuration to log detailed API response codes for better diagnostics.
Add Monitoring: Implement monitoring on payment gateway API calls to detect and alert on authentication failures.
Credential Vault: Integrate a centralized, secure credential vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to manage API credentials with automated rotation and auditing.
Pre-Deployment Tests: Develop automated tests to verify all third-party API integrations before deploying updates.
Incident Response Training: Conduct training sessions for the engineering team on effective incident response and debugging practices to handle similar issues more efficiently in the future.
By addressing these areas, we aim to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring and improve our overall system reliability and response times.
